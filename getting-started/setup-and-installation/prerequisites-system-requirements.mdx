# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This guide details the essential requirements you must meet before installing and using the GORM ClickHouse Driver. Ensuring your environment complies with these prerequisites is critical for a smooth setup experience and reliable operation.

---

## 1. Supported Go and GORM Versions

- **Go Language:**
  - Use Go version 1.16 or later for full compatibility.
- **GORM:**
  - Compatible with GORM v2, the latest stable GORM ORM version.
  - Older GORM versions are not supported.

<Tip>
Confirm your Go and GORM versions before proceeding by running:
```bash
go version
gopkg.in/gorm.v2 v2.0.0 or later
```
</Tip>

## 2. ClickHouse Server Requirements

- **Version:**
  - ClickHouse server must be version 20.4 or higher to support all driver features.
  - Avoid using versions below 20.4, which lack critical features such as renaming columns and column precision support.
- **Network Accessibility:**
  - Ensure the ClickHouse server is reachable from your Go application environment.
  - Default ports used by the driver are:
    - HTTP interface: `8123` (mapped externally as you configure)
    - Native TCP interface: `9000`
    - TCP interface for inter-server communication: `9009`

<Info>
The official Docker image `yandex/clickhouse-server:latest` can be used to quickly launch a compliant ClickHouse server.

Sample docker-compose snippet:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  server:
    image: yandex/clickhouse-server:latest
    environment:
      - CLICKHOUSE_DB=gorm
      - CLICKHOUSE_USER=gorm
      - CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=gorm
    ports:
      - 9941:8123
      - 9942:9000
      - 9943:9009
```
Adapt port mappings as needed for your environment.
</Info>

## 3. Operating System & Hardware

- The GORM ClickHouse driver is platform independent and runs anywhere Go is supported.
- Recommended minimum system requirements for running ClickHouse server:
  - Linux-based OS (recommended for best performance), but Docker-based deployment works cross-platform.
  - At least 4GB of RAM and a modern multi-core CPU.
  - Stable network connection for database communication.

## 4. Environment Dependencies

- **Docker (Optional but Recommended):**
  - To facilitate ClickHouse server installation and to manage dependencies efficiently, Docker is highly recommended.
  - Docker Compose is useful for managing multi-container setups (e.g., clustering).
- **Network Configuration:**
  - Open required ports between your application server and ClickHouse server (default 9000 for native TCP, 8123 for HTTP).
  - Firewall rules should allow these connections.

## 5. Database Credentials

Before connecting, ensure you have the following credentials:

- Username (default: `gorm` in example)
- Password
- Database name (default: `gorm` in example)

Use these in your DSN connection string.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Incorrect Port Mapping:**
  - Verify your Docker port mappings match the DSN used in your application.
  - For example, if the Docker `9000` port is mapped to `9942` on localhost, your DSN must reflect `localhost:9942`.

- **Outdated ClickHouse Version:**
  - Attempting to use features like column renaming on ClickHouse versions below 20.4 will fail.

- **Missing or Misconfigured Credentials:**
  - Ensure your ClickHouse server user has the required permissions and your DSN includes the correct username and password.

- **Firewall Issues:**
  - Network timeouts often stem from blocked ports; verify connectivity.

## Verification Checklist

After confirming prerequisites, verify your setup:

1. **Check Go and GORM versions:**
   ```bash
go version
go list -m all | grep gorm
```
2. **Ensure ClickHouse server is running and listening:**
   ```bash
docker ps
# and
netstat -tuln | grep 9000
```
3. **Test connectivity with `clickhouse-client` or TCP tool:**
   ```bash
clickhouse-client --host=localhost --port=9942 --user=gorm --password=gorm
```
4. **Review logs for errors or warnings.**

## Next Steps

Once all prerequisites are met, proceed to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installation) to install and configure the GORM ClickHouse driver.

For a deeper understanding of ClickHouse concepts such as clustering, granularity, and compression, consult the [Core Terminology Guide](/overview/architecture-and-concepts/core-terminology).

For hands-on examples of migrations and CRUD operations, refer to the [Database Migrations and Table Options](/guides/getting-started/running-migrations) and [Performing Basic CRUD Operations](/guides/getting-started/basic-crud) pages.
